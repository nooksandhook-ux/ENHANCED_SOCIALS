Quote-Based Reward System for Nigerian Readers
Overview
This system rewards Nigerian users for reading books by allowing them to submit quotes from real books and earn ₦10 for each verified quote. The goal is to incentivize reading while providing small financial rewards that can help with daily expenses like airtime, data, or snacks.
Core Philosophy

"Reading helped me get better at life and now I earn. But if only I had ways to get small money to cater for small things like airtime, internet data, sweets, or minor things that small cash could handle, life would have been a lot easier."

This system bridges the gap between reading for personal growth and earning small amounts for daily needs, specifically targeting Nigerian readers who understand the value of books but need financial motivation.
How It Works
For Users:

Add Books: Users can add books to their library either by:
Selecting from existing books in their collection
Searching and adding new books via Google Books API
Manually uploading books with PDFs (flagged for admin verification)


Read Uploaded Books: Users can open their uploaded PDFs directly from the library by clicking the "Read Now" button, which displays the book in their browser for immediate reading.
Submit Quotes: Users submit exact quotes from books they're reading:
Quote text must be verbatim (exactly as written in the book)
Must include the correct page number
Minimum 10 characters, maximum 1000 characters
Each verified quote earns ₦10


Track Progress: Users can monitor:
Pending quotes awaiting verification
Verified quotes and earnings
Rejected quotes with reasons
Total balance and transaction history



For Admins:

Quote Verification Queue: Admins see all pending quotes with:
User information
Book details (title, author, cover)
Quote text and page number
Submission timestamp


Accessing PDFs for Verification: For books with uploaded PDFs, admins can access the decrypted PDF via the library’s “Read Now” button to verify quotes against the original text.
Verification Process: Admins manually verify quotes by:
Cross-referencing with the actual book
Checking page numbers match
Ensuring quotes are verbatim
Approving or rejecting with reasons


Bulk Operations: Admins can:
Approve multiple quotes at once
Bulk reject with common reasons
View system-wide statistics

They open the uploaded PDF via the "Read Now" button to read in their browser

Admin Workflow

Quote Submission Book Filter Logic
Purpose:To ensure that users can only submit quotes from books they are actively engaging with (i.e., not from books they haven’t started reading).
Backend Query Logic:
books = list(current_app.mongo.db.books.find({
    'user_id': user_id,
    'status': {'$in': ['reading', 'finished']}
}).sort('title', 1))


user_id: Filters only the books owned by the current user.
status: Limits results to books marked as 'reading' or 'finished' to prevent quoting from unread books.
sort: Alphabetical ordering by title for dropdown convenience.

Frontend UX Enhancements:

Hint MessageIf the user sees “No books found in your library,” a tooltip or note is shown:
"Only books marked as reading or finished will appear here. Go to your library to update statuses."


Go to My Library Button  
Replaces the “Add New Book” button.
Routes user to /manage_library where they can update statuses.



Why This Matters:

Promotes genuine reading and discourages spammy quote submissions.
Keeps the quote verification process more reliable for admins.
Helps users understand system behavior without confusion.

Manage Library – Functional Overview

PDF Accessibility

Route: nook.serve_pdf
Access Control: Only the book’s owner or an admin can access the PDF.
Behavior:
Opens the PDF in-browser using inline rendering for immediate reading.
Includes a tooltip (“Open this book in your browser”) on the “Read Now” button for clarity.
Handles errors (e.g., missing files, decryption failures) with user-friendly flash messages and redirects to /manage_library.


Security: PDFs are encrypted on upload and decrypted on-the-fly with ownership checks.


Book Status Management

Edit Route: nook.edit_book
Purpose: Lets users update a book’s status (to_read, reading, finished) and other metadata.
Impact: 
Status controls whether the book appears in the quote submission dropdown.
Encourages users to mark reading progress accurately to unlock quote rewards.




Secure Book Deletion

Delete Method: CSRF-protected form (DeleteBookForm) passed to the template.
Safety: Ensures only the book’s owner can delete their book, preventing misuse.
UX: Uses Bootstrap confirmation and clean flash messages to confirm deletion.


Quote System Integration

Dropdown Logic: Quote submission view only lists books with status reading or finished.
Sync: Matches the same status logic used in the library, reducing confusion for users.


User Experience Highlights

Read Button: Prominent, tooltip-enabled “Read Now” button encourages usage.
Flash Messages: Guide the user when files are unavailable or actions are restricted.
UI Design: Consistent Bootstrap design with icons and spacing for clear navigation.


Library vs. Manage Library

/library: Provides a filtered view of books (by status, genre, etc.) for browsing.
/manage_library: Allows users to read PDFs, edit book details (including status), and delete books.



Remember: This system is built specifically for Nigerian readers who understand the transformative power of books and need small financial incentives to support their reading journey. Every verified quote represents not just ₦10 earned, but knowledge gained and personal growth achieved.
